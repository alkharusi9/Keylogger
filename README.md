This simple scirpt could be used to record all keyboard inputs and send it to the attacker's email. You still might need to convert it to an EXE file and send it to the victim via email or install it and run it by yourself if you can reach the victim's device.There are also some other ways to hide and deliever the tool to the victim that you can look them up online.There might be some modules that need to be installed and imported such as pynput for the code to start running so make sure you install them while testing the tool.
